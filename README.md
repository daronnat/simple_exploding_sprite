# Simple Exploding Sprite (Godot Engine 3)
This simple Godot project allows to import a picture/sprite and make it "explode" into tiny fragments.
The intensity and direction of the explosion can be controlled from code.

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply import it using Godot Engine 3.2 (not sure of the compatibility of this project with Godot Engine version > 3.2).
Then run the scene file from the "2D" panel (Node2D.tscn).
